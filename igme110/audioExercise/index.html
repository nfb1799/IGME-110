    <p>
        I made a story of a woman drinking some displeasing coffee, spitting it out, then smashing the cup on the ground.
        <br />
        I found the background music as well as the glass breaking sound online. The other sounds I created myself in Audacity. 
        <br />
        The background music was very loud and overpowering so I had to place a filter on that decreasing its volume. 
        <br />
        The mic I used to record the slurp and spit sounds had a lot of noise so I had to record on low sensitivity and place
        <br />
        a filter on them to increase their volumes.
