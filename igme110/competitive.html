        Competitive Melee
    </h1>

    <p>
        <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> is one of the most popular esports in 2019, 18 years after the game's release. Never fully receiving the
        support of Nintendo, the explosion of the competitive scene was a massive grassroots effort.
        <br /> <br />
        The first competitive <i>Melee</i> tournament was held in a player's basement on April 6, 2002. It was advertised on an online forum and
        had a turnout of about 20 players. This tournament sparked a massive uprising of small tournament across the country.
        <br /> <br />
        During the early years of the competitive scene, a brand called Major League Gaming started a <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> circuit making
        it possible for players to call themselves "professional" and to make a living playing this video game.
        <br /> <br />
        Players like Ken and Azen constantly pushed each other and the game to their limits, showing spectators what was truly possible
        in this game. They were the pioners of <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> and inspired thousands upon thousands of players to play the very best game they could.
