        Overview
    </h1>

    <p>
        <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> was released by Nintendo in 2001. It is a party game supported a cast of Nintendo's most well known characters.
        Earning the title of Fighting Game of the Year, this game was an absolute hit and continues to enter hundreds of thousands of players.
        Within those thousands of players exists two groups: casual players and competitive players. 
        <br /> <br />
        It is that ambiguity that makes <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> such a beautiful game. For casual gamers, it is a game you can play for hours on end, messing
        around and having a great time with friends. For competitive gamers, it is one of the most technical fighting games of all time with a skill ceiling higher
        than most. It caters to all demographics of players and is one of the most influential fighting games of all time.
        <br /> <br />
        There is a fundamental difference from other fighting games in the way characters take damage. In most fighting games, characters have a damage bar that is 
        chipped away by opponents attacks until that bar reaches 0. In <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>, characters have a percent meter that increases with each hit. 
        The higher the percent, the higher the knockback a character receives when hit.
