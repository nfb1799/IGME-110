        The Gods
    </h1>

    <p>
        The five Gods of <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> are players who, in their time, could be beat by no one but each other.
        From left to right, their tags are Mang0, Armada, Mew2King, PPMD, and Hungrybox. These players showed what the highest level of play looked like
        and inspired so many new players to try the game.
        <br /><br />
        Each god has a unique personality and playstyle, giving all kinds of spectators someone to identify with. The community has these players
        to thank for propelling the game into the late 2010's and continuing to show just how far the game can be pushed.
        <br /><br />
        Two of the five, Armada and PPMD, have recently retired from competitive play leaving room for new talent to rise to the top of the ranks.
        Hungrybox, Mew2King, and Mang0 still compete, however upholding their titles of "Gods."
